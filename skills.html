            <h1>About Stefan</h1>
            <p>I possess a strong skill set in both object-oriented programming (OOP) and structured programming, which enables me to tackle complex software development tasks with precision and efficiency. In the realm of structured programming, I have honed my abilities to break down problems into manageable components, employing techniques such as procedural design, modular programming, and step-wise refinement. This approach allows me to develop robust and maintainable code that is easy to understand and debug. Additionally, my expertise in object-oriented programming empowers me to create flexible and scalable solutions. I excel at designing classes and objects that encapsulate data and behavior, fostering code reusability and modularity. Leveraging concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, I can construct well-organized systems that promote code readability, extensibility, and maintainability. Whether it's crafting efficient algorithms, designing intuitive user interfaces, or implementing intricate data structures, my proficiency in both structured and object-oriented programming equips me to navigate the intricacies of software development and deliver high-quality solutions.</p>
