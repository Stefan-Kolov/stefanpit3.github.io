            <p>I have embarked on an educational journey that has equipped me with a strong foundation in the field of electronics and telecommunications. I successfully completed my high school education at SUGS "Vlado Tasevski," where I pursued a specialization as an electronic and telecommunications technician.</p>
            <p>During this time, I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in areas such as circuitry, signal processing, telecommunications systems, and electronic troubleshooting. Building upon this solid background, I have further expanded my academic pursuits and I am currently studying at Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI).</p>
            <p>Here, I am immersing myself in a comprehensive curriculum that encompasses various aspects of computer science, software engineering, and information technology. Through engaging coursework, practical projects, and collaboration with esteemed faculty and fellow students, I am constantly broadening my understanding of cutting-edge technologies and refining my problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>My education at FINKI is not only preparing me for a successful career in the ever-evolving world of technology but also fostering my passion for innovation and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the digital realm.</p>
