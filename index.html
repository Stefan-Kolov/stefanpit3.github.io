            <br>
            <p>My name is Stefan Kolov, and I am a 19-year-old boy with a deep passion for the field of computer science and engineering. Currently, I am studying at the Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering, commonly known as FINKI, where I am actively expanding my knowledge and skills in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.</p>
            <p>From a young age, I have been captivated by technology and its potential to shape the world around us. This fascination led me to pursue a career path that would allow me to explore and contribute to the exciting realm of computer science and engineering. Choosing FINKI as my educational institution was an obvious choice, as it is renowned for its rigorous curriculum and exceptional faculty members who are experts in their respective domains.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time at FINKI, I have been exposed to a diverse range of subjects, from programming languages and algorithms to computer networks and artificial intelligence. The faculty has provided me with a strong foundation in theoretical concepts while also offering practical experiences through hands-on projects and internships.</p>
            <p>While my education is of utmost importance to me, I am also eager to gain real-world experience and apply my knowledge in practical settings. I am actively seeking job opportunities that will allow me to contribute to the industry and further develop my skills. I am excited to work alongside professionals in the field, learn from their expertise, and make a meaningful impact.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I am excited about the journey that lies ahead, and I am eager to seize every opportunity that comes my way to contribute to the field of computer science and engineering.</p>
